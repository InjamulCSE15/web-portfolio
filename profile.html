        <h3>World Class Professional Web Developer</h3>
        <p><span class="letter">I'</span>m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.<br>
        I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.</p>

        <h2>My Goal</h2>
        <h3>Why become a Web developer?</h3>
        <p><span class="letter">W</span>orld wide web is everywhere or everyone is on world wide web. If www doesn't existed you are not able to post this question and I will not get an opportunity to express my opinion to this question and as a web developer you have the ability to involve in this movement and be the frontier of the revolution if you wish too. You can help other lead by following them or can help other by leading them.<br>
        Web gave us all a lot. I want to thank each and everyone who put their work in making our life easy and that is why I choose to be a web developer Now it is my turn to make people life easy and make this world a better place.
