        <h3>World Class Professional Web Developer</h3>
        <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
        I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.</p>
